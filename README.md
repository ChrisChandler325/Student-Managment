# Student-Managment
In this project I created an application in C# using the .NET Framework that allows you to create, edit and add multiple students. Along with these students you can give each of them coureses that they are taking. This creates student objects and saves an array of classes to each student independently. 
This file is too large to upload into github at one time and had to zip it.
